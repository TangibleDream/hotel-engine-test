In your language of choice and using any reasonable set of libraries/modules, create a project with browser based tests for the following acceptance criteria for github.com:

- As a guest (not logged-in), when I search github for the term "create-react-app" from the landing page search input, I see:
  - A count of matching results
  - The facebook/create-create-app project as the first result
- As a guest, when I click the "About" button in the landing page footer I am taken to the GitHub "About" page


Please add a short README with instructions for the HE Devs on how to run the rests in the project. thanks in advance!

For submitting the code, please either either upload that project to a public git repo somewhere (ideally GitHub or GitLab) or provide us with a zip file with the code.
